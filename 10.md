# Renewal Process

### Renewing Protection Periods

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Notification**  
   - When the lock time is approaching expiration (pause time), both owner and protector receive notifications from the Seashell website  

2. **Owner Decision**  
   - Owner must choose whether to renew or not  

**If Owner Chooses to Renew:**

- Specify additional time period  
- May need to provide updated proof of item condition  
- Optionally request increased collateral  

**Protector Decision:**

- Notified of renewal request  
- Must choose to accept or reject  

**If Protector Accepts:**

- Contract is renewed for the specified period  
- Additional collateral requirements are processed  

**If Protector Rejects:**

- Process returns to redemption path  
- Owner must collect their physical item  

**If Owner Chooses Not to Renew:**

- The process moves to redemption  
- Owner must collect their physical item  

**Important Considerations:**

- Renewal requests must be processed before the protection period ends  
- Both parties must agree to renewal terms  
- Changes in collateral requirements must be clearly specified
