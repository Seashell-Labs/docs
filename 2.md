# About Seashell Network


### What is Seashell Network?

Seashell Network is a decentralized platform that allows users to convert physical items into on-chain NFTs. By storing physical items with trusted protectors, users can tokenize their possessions while maintaining ownership rights and the ability to redeem them later.

### Core Features

- **Physical-to-Digital Conversion**: Transform physical items into blockchain NFTs  
- **Decentralized Storage**: A network of protectors secures physical items  
- **Trustless System**: Built on blockchain technology with transparent processes  
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven decision making  
- **Rewards Ecosystem**: Benefits for all participants  

### Vision

Seashell Network aims to bridge the gap between physical assets and digital ownership, creating new opportunities for asset management, trading, and utilities in both the physical and digital realms.

### Blockchain Support

While NFTs are minted on Ethereum mainnet, Seashell Network will operate across multiple blockchains (to be announced).
