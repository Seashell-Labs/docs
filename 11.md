# Redemption Process

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Redemption Request**  
   - Owner visits the Seashell website  
   - Initiates redemption through the smart contract  
   - The contract notifies the protector  

2. **Item Return**  
   - Protector prepares and sends the physical item to the owner  
   - Provides shipping or transfer details  

3. **Confirmation Process**  
   - Owner receives the item  
   - Uploads proof of receipt and delivery notice  

4. **Satisfaction Decision**  
   - If satisfied: Confirm, release collateral, end process  
   - If unsatisfied: Submit report, DAO evaluates, resolve with proofs  

**Important Notes:**

- Only the current NFT owner can initiate redemption  
- All proof submissions are stored on-chain for transparency  
- DAO decisions are final and executed through smart contracts  
- Redemption starts automatically if renewal is declined  
- Built-in dispute resolution mechanisms are in place
