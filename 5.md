# Security and Trust
### Smart Contract Security

- All smart contracts will undergo professional auditing before launch  
- Audits will be conducted by recognized security firms  
- Results will be made public for transparency  

### Physical Item Security

- Protectors provide collateral as insurance against loss or damage  
- Collateral is typically 100% of the item's value  
- DAO oversight provides additional security layer  

### Dispute Resolution

- DAO evaluates evidence in case of disputes  
- Transparent decision-making process  
- Compensation from protector collateral when appropriate  

### Security Best Practices

Always check the status of the NFT on the website, and check it is active and how much collateral is locked for the NFT. Look for the proofs and history of changes.

**IMPORTANT**: Items are not reviewed by Seashell foundation or any other auditors. At worst scenarios you can report a suspicious activity and Seashell's DAO will look into the case and proofs. Bad actors are penalized and their collateral can be deducted or banned from the system forever!
